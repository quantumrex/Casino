Casino
Version 0.01

This Is my first attempt at a plugin, so don't laugh too hard when you see it...

I want to create a basic interface for players to set up Vegas-Style Casino 
businesses for themselves under Minecraft. It will allow owners to create game
machines for their patrons, and to make a profit from their use.

I want these machines to allow other non-owner players to play mini-games 
setup by the owner. These pay dividends on a random basis, or otherwise as the 
game dictates.

The casino will be run using the iConomy Plugin, Permissions plugin, and 
possibly BetterShop. 

As of right now, I have only 4 games that I plan to implement, though adding 
more is a definite possibility at a later date. These include:

A Slot Machine

A Roulette Wheel

A BlackJack Table

A Shell Game

A Raffle or Lottery is also a possibility.
